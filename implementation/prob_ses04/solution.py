# find node and delete it using sequence find (by index )
# sequence AVL tree is sorted by index not by value
# index is size of node -1
# we agument tree node by store height and size (which is number of nodes )
# but after delete/ insert dynamic operations we need to update these properties along with inserted/deleted node ancestores
# and this isn't costly only takes n times where n -> is the number of nodes in the subtree
